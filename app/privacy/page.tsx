        <p className="mt-3">
          We collect account email addresses for authentication, workspace and
          billing metadata, connected Instagram account identifiers, encrypted
          Instagram access tokens, campaign settings, webhook payloads, comments
          needed to process campaigns, delivery logs, and operational
          diagnostics.

        <p className="mt-3">
          We use this data to authenticate users, connect Instagram
          integrations, match comment keywords, send private replies through the
          official Meta APIs, prevent duplicate sends, troubleshoot failures,
          and protect the service.

          Instagram And Meta Data
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          OpenReply does not ask for Instagram passwords, scrape Instagram, or
          use browser automation. Instagram tokens are encrypted at rest and are
          used only to perform actions authorized by the connected business
          account.

          The production service runs on Hetzner infrastructure in Falkenstein,
          Germany. PostgreSQL stores application data and Redis operates the
          private delivery queue on the same application host network. Resend
          delivers authentication emails. These providers process data only as
          needed to operate OpenReply. We do not sell Meta Platform Data.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Retention And Deletion</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Customers can disconnect Instagram from settings, which removes the
          stored Instagram connection and stops its campaigns. Application data
          is retained while the workspace is active and as needed for security,
          billing, fraud prevention, or legal obligations. Verified deletion
          requests are handled through the Data Deletion page linked below.
